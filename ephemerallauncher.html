	We are downloading and using more and more smartphone apps everyday; to the point that managing
	and accessing these apps is a usability issue. This trend of using apps is going to be even more 
	prominent in the future.
	Ephemeral launcher uses a visual highlighting technique called <em>ephemeral adaptation</em> to
	highlight likely-to-be-used apps in a way that improves access performance even when prediction
	algorithms with low accuracy (80%) are used. Furthermore, it has been designed to not compromise
	aesthetics and also be preferred subjectively by users.
	In this project we implemented the idea of ephemeral adaptation for app launching on Android to be
	able to prototype and test possible visual effects in controlled experiments.
	We have been a team of three people working on this project and I have been involved in idea generation,
	design, implementation, experimental design, and conducting the experiment.
