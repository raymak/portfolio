					Contextual feature recommender (CFR) is an idea intended to make users aware of features of a system
					that could improve their use of the system. It is based on the observation that any non-trivial software
					contains many tools that each user might only benefit from a unique subset of them. To help users find their
					personal subset of features, CFR observes their behavior, infers what features they might benefit from, and
					eventually introduces these features in unbtrusive way at the right moment.
					I devised this idea and started working on it when I was interning at Mozilla's user research team. There I designed and
					implemented multiple variations of this system  as a Firefox addon. It recommended features such as keyboard shortcuts, extensions, private browsing, etc. to the users if the user was likely to benefit based on their behavior. I conducted a preliminary experiment by remotely deploying it on some 16000 users' Firefox browsers for a week. I then collected the data and did a preliminary analysis
					to see whether people have adopted the recommended features. 

					I am now continuing to work on this project as my Master's thesis. This problem is essentially interesting because it involves many of the challenges of designing proactive data-driven intelligent systems such as obtrusiveness, privacy invasion, lack of intelligibility, etc.
