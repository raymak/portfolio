	<p>
		Inspired by recent neural studies, this project uses competition between neurons as a form of nonlinearity to design an artificial neural network. This work was based on a recent paper presented at NIPS (...), where this idea was first introduced. In particular, these type of neural networks can achieve results as good as other state-of-the-art techniques such as (...) and (...), while preventing catastrophic forgetting when trained with a new dataset. 
		We defined this project as the course project for our graduate computational neuroscience course.
