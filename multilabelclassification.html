	<h1 class="proj-title">Bayesian Multilabel Classification Using Active Learning</h1>
	<p>
		This project involves writing a machine learning framework for classification of multilabel datasets using active learning. This problem is becoming increasingly important due to advent of new web-based applications that use techniques, such as automatically labeling content with tags, in order to help users browse the conent more easily. A typical example of such applications is automated tagging system on Youtube. In such scenarios use of active learning becomes particulary essential due to the large number of output labels each instance of data has. This framework is based on works presented in (...) and (...). We have extended some of the ideas presented in these papers. One example is use of nonlinear kernels and studying the interaction between the compression ratio and use of kernels on the resulting accuracy.
